# KDE Optimization Guide

This document outlines the optimization choices and configurations applied to the KDE Plasma desktop for the developer workstation, focusing on performance, productivity, and remote access reliability.

## 🪟 Tiling Window Management: Karousel

For window management, we have transitioned from **Polonium** to **Karousel**.

### Why Karousel?
While Polonium was a robust tiling solution, it has been **archived upstream** by its maintainers. Karousel was chosen as the primary tiling extension for several key reasons:
- **Active Maintenance**: Karousel is actively developed and receives regular updates.
- **Plasma 6 Support**: It provides native support for Plasma 6, ensuring longevity during the Debian transition from Plasma 5 to 6.
- **Dynamic Workflows**: Karousel offers a unique "scrolling" tiling workflow that prevents windows from becoming too small on smaller screens or laptop displays.
- **Stability**: Karousel is built with modern KWin APIs, reducing the risk of crashes compared to archived scripts.

### Shortcuts (Karousel)
- **Meta + Arrow Keys**: Move focus between windows.
- **Meta + Shift + Arrow Keys**: Move windows within the tile layout.
- **Meta + F**: Toggle Fullscreen.

## ⚡ Performance First: RDP Optimization

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) performance is the highest priority for this workstation. High-latency visual effects can significantly degrade the user experience over XRDP.

### Disabling Desktop Effects
To minimize bandwidth usage and latency, the following visual "eye candy" features are disabled by default:
- **Blur**: One of the most expensive effects for remote rendering.
- **Magic Lamp / Animations**: Minimizing/maximizing animations are disabled to provide instant UI feedback.
- **Translucency**: Disabled to reduce compositor overhead.

### Compositor Settings
- **Latency**: Set to "Force lowest latency" to ensure mouse and keyboard input feel responsive.
- **Rendering Backend**: Optimized for the virtual framebuffers used by XRDP.

## 🚀 Plasma 5 to 6 Transition

Debian 13 (Trixie) marks a significant transition period between KDE Plasma 5 and Plasma 6.
- **Compatibility Layers**: Our automation detects the installed Plasma version and applies version-specific configurations (e.g., KWin script paths differ between versions).
- **Future-Proofing**: By selecting tools like Karousel, we ensure that the workstation remains functional after a system upgrade to Plasma 6.

## 🛠️ Developer Tools & Workflows

A set of high-impact KDE-native tools are pre-installed to enhance the development lifecycle.

### Yakuake (Drop-down Terminal)
- **Workflow**: Accessible via **F12**, it provides a Quake-style terminal that slides down from the top of the screen.
- **Benefit**: Eliminates the need to manage terminal windows or toggle between tasks.

### Spectacle (Screenshots & Annotation)
- **Workflow**: Triggered by **PrintScreen**.
- **Benefit**: Provides rapid screen capture with built-in annotation tools, essential for documenting bugs or sharing UI feedback.

### Performance Profiling Tools
We include heavy-duty profiling visualizers by default:
- **KCacheGrind**: A visualization tool for profiling data generated by tools like Xdebug or Valgrind. It helps identify "hot paths" in code execution.
- **Heaptrack**: A heap memory profiler for C/C++ that tracks all memory allocations and deallocations to find memory leaks and optimization opportunities.

## ⌨️ Summary of Key Shortcuts
